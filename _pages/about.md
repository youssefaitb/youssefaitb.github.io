Welcome on my personal website! 

My name is Youssef Ait Benasser, and I am a 4th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Oregon. I work on international trade policy, and attempt to think through consequences of the significant shifts that the global trade order is experiencing. My first two papers study policy symmetry and uncertainty in this context. I am also an avid reader of the African trade literature, and a constant seeker of the missing African trade (where is it?). When I am not thinking about economic and trade policy, or engaged in existential dread, I can be found playing Oud, obsessively reading queer and afrofutirist scifi, or browsing through dog shelter adoption ads and counting the days until I can move-in with a shepherd mix.
