title: "Measuring Trade Policy Uncertainty and Its Impact on Financial Market Volatility"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-paper2
excerpt: 'I construct an empirical index to measure perceptions of trade policy uncertainty. The index incorporates Twitter data and policy signals from the USTR published notices and calls for comments. The index performs well compared to existing measures and displays the desirable properties of smoothness, timeliness, and consistency with policy developments. Using the index, I study the response of stock market volatility to TPU. Volatility responds negatively to trade policy uncertainty in the 2015-2020 study period. This is a departure from the literature-documented positive relationship between economic policy uncertainty and volatility. The financial impact of TPU in the recent high-uncertainty period is less far-reaching than suggested by news commentary. Stocks that are not exposed to trade are not significantly affected by shocks to TPU.'
