Economics and me 
------
My dedication to learning about and contributing to economic knowledge originates in a larger passion for dynamic social systems. I grew up in a space where cultural constructs, social norms, political overreach, economic struggles, and religious beliefs seemed to constantly collapse into one another. The identities that I carry put me at odds with many of these otherwise impercitible forces. And the constant tensions and hesitations of a country that is in perpetual transition emphasized the emphasized the complexity of the systems at play. I was fascinated. I have since never ceased to be. 

So in college, I chose the most multidisciplinary social science program that I knew off. Sciences Po undegraduate program operated very much beyond disciplines. This made it an excellent gateway to the study of those dynamic social systems that I was so anxious to understand, analyze and critic. I used the flexibility of my year abroad at the University of Southern California to focus on two vantage angles : the history of religions, and political science. Through these exposures, I was becoming increasingly aware that the system that (tw: controversial statement) mattered most, in informing and in eclipsing the others was the economy. 

Production relations, labor markets, trade networks, government policies, agents' decision patterns are what comes to mind when I hear the word economics. As economics continues to trend away from its original subject matter, and rebrand itself as a a versatile prism able to refract any and all things human, my passion for economics is very much about the good old fashioned economy. Value production relations and the rules that govern them are the core of what my focus is as an economist, and as an economist, the tools that I have inherited from centuries of economic research allow increasingly rigorous conceptually modelling and empirical quantification. The history of economics is indeed one of amazing progress at the service of improved human welfare. It is a tradition that I am proud to belong to and that I strive to participate in. 

The current moment in the history of economic thought is however a peculiar one. In my work, I use concepts such as incentives, utility, otpimization, rationality, exogeneity when applicable, but I deny these concepts the primacy that neo-classical economics has given them. The theories are helpful. The praxis however has accepted these theories as uncontested assumptions pushing the discipline to claim authority over an ever expanding field of questions. This, in my view, poses epistemological and ethical concerns that I will not delve into here. Suffice it to give the example of the treatment of race in economics from the early days of the AEA to today as an "exogenous" variable, and not an endogenous production of the dynamic system itself that cannot exist outside of it.

But, there is hope .... Econ's anthropological overreach can become an opportunity for inter or postdisciplinary research. Economic thinking can infrom many of the themes that have triggered economists' interests from crime, to religious comittment, identity, gender, etc. But it cannot do it alone in an imperialist approach that disregards the knowledge accumulated in other disciplnary praxes and claim the sufficiency of economic priors in addressing fundemantelly non-economic topics. I hope to be able to participate in moving economics towards this postdisciplinary world, where the profession is, outwardly-curious, less overreaching, and more ambitious.
