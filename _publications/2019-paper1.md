permalink: /publication/2019-paper1
excerpt: 'Is trade policy symmetric? Using a dataset of trade agreements from 1986 to 2016, I identify 126 instances of trade liberalization reversals where standing agreements are revoked and barriers to trade are reintroduced. I study the impact of these reversals on import volumes to reveal whether trade flows responses to positive and negative liberalization shocks are symmetric. Some of weak evidence of positive trade policy asymmetry emerges : trade volumes appear to respond more to favorable shocks. However, the hypothesis of perfect policy symmetry cannot be rejected at credible confidence levels.'
