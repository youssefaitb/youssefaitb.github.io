Economics and me 
------
My dedication to learning about and contributing to economic knowledge originates in a larger passion for dynamic social systems. I grew up in a space where cultural constructs, social norms, political overreach, economic struggles, and religious beliefs seemed to constantly collapse into one another. The identities that I carry put me at odds with many of these otherwise impercitible forces. And the constant tensions and hesitations of a country that is in perpetual transition emphasized the emphasized the complexity of the systems at play. I was fascinated. I have since never ceased to be. 

So in college, I chose the most multidisciplinary social science program that I knew off. Sciences Po undegraduate program operated very much beyond disciplines. This made it an excellent gateway to the study of those dynamic social systems that I was so anxious to understand, analyze and critic. I used the flexibility of my year abroad at the University of Southern California to focus on two vantage angles : the history of religions, and political science. Through these exposures, I was becoming increasingly aware that the system that (tw: controversial statement) mattered most, in informing and in eclipsing the others was the economy.
